                    <p>Our mission is to raise great soccer players and good human beings. Each of our practices focuses not only on developing soccer skills but also on teaching team play, respect, and a healthy lifestyle.</p>
                    <p>Our teams participate in CMSA games and soccer tournaments. Our most recent success is a bronze medal in the CMSA winter 2018/2019 season for our Boys U11 team. Although we train hard, match results are not our priority. Our goal is long-term player development. To achieve that we provide a stress-free environment and practices that are fun and aimed at building skills and character in a balanced way.</p>

                    <p>White Eagles Polish Canadian Sport Association was formed in 1948 as the result of the initiative of a group of Polish immigrants, many of whom were war veterans. Headed by Pawel Machulik and Jan Rokita, White Eagles was a volunteer organization whose goal was to promote sports among the Polish community in Calgary.</p>
                    <p>The official White Eagles Club was formed in 1951 with Antoni Suminski as president and Marian Baranowski as vice-president. As there were enough young men in the Polish community to form a soccer team, the club grew and was supported by the Polish Canadian Association, and the Polish Combatant Association.</p>

                    <p>The club brought sports-minded members of the Polish community together. Each game was an opportunity to meet, talk and spend time with family in an active way.</p>
                    <p>The dedication and persistence led to the team winning the 'Scotland Cup' tournament in 1953 with captain Stanislaw Gajecki.</p>

            <p class="about-timeline-text">In the late sixties the club experienced a decline in membership, and it wasn't until 1973 that White Eagles saw a comeback. Thanks to <strong>Jack Kuczaj</strong>, <strong>Tadeusz Czenczek</strong>, and <strong>Zdzislaw Kucharski</strong>, a new team was formed. Their enthusiasm paid off and White Eagles won third place in Division One of the Calgary United Soccer Association in 1977.</p>
